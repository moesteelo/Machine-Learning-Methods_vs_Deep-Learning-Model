# Machine-Learning-Methods_vs_Deep-Learning-Model
**Comparing Different Machine Learning Methods to Deep Learning Models and how to use each models based on their datas.**

## Overview

### Logistic Regression Model vs Basic Neural Network 

**A logistic regression model is a classification algorithm that can analyze continuous and categorical variables. Using a combination of input variables, logistic regression predicts the probability of the input data belonging to one of two groups. Also statistical model that mathematically determines its probability of belonging to one of two groups.**

**In Basic Neural Network the sigmoid curve is the exact same curve used in the sigmoid activation function of a neural network.**


- **In the [LogisticRegression_NeuralNet](LogisticRegression_NeuralNet.ipynb) file we demonstrate how similar the logistic regression and basic neural network models are in terms of performance, we'll also build and evaluate both models using the same training/testing dataset using the ***Diabetes Dataset.*****

#### Results 

- **we compare both model's predictive accuracy, their output is very similar. Either model was able to predict whether or not a patient is diagnosed with diabetes more than 70% of the time.**
